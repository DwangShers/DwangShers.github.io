### Topic : Transaction and Serializability

In our flipped class we learned about transactions in database which I will be sharing the knowledge I acquired from the flipped class. So, do go through my journal.

### What is a Transaction?
A transaction is a collection of operations that together form a single logical unit of work. This unit of work can access and potentially update various data items.
It ensures that either all the operations are completed successfully, or not at all.
