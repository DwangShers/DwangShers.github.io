## Topic : Traffic Analysis Essentials
----
I am solving this room (Traffic Analysis Essentials) which is based on Network Security and Traffic Analysis and the goal of solving this room is listed below. 

#### Goal
Learn Network Security and Traffic Analysis foundations and take a step into probing network animalies.

### Introduction
Network security is the protection of the underlying networking infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, or theft. It involves creating a secure infrastructure for devices, applications, users, and applications to work in a secure manner. It focuses on the system design, operation and management of the architecture/infrastructure to provide network accessibility, integrity, continuity and reliability.
