There are 2 ports open that are ssh and  http. Letâ€™s check the webpage for this machine.

We need to login to solve this room.

### Task 1: CyberHeroes
#### Q. Uncover the flag!

To login we need username and password but we don't have it. So check source code to gain more information.

There is a javascript code where username and reverse string is mentioned. Now taking that reverse string we can get the original password with the command line echo.

So the password for user h3ck3rBoi is SuperSecret@12345

By using that credentials we can successfully logged into the website and there we find the flag.

Answer: flag{edb0be532c540b1a150c3a7e85d2466e}

### Conclusion
Source code usually contains vulnerabilities, in this case also contains username and password but password is in reverse string.
