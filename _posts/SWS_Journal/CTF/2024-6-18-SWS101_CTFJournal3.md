This is a machine that allows you to practice web app hacking and privilege escalation.

There are 6 ports open. Let's check http server.

The website is under maintenance.

### Task 1: Web App Testing and Privilege Escalation 
#### What is the name of the hidden directory on the web server(enter name without /)?

I used gobuster to find the hidden directory. I have used this word list:

https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt

![alt text](</image/CTF/Basic Pentesting/pentest1.png>)

I found that there is a directory as /development.

Answer: development

#### What is the username?
When I check the /development directory, there are 2 txt files(dev.txt and j.txt).

This is the content of dev.txt

This is the content of j.txt.

This 2 file does not contain the full name of the user.

{enum4linux 10.10.24.174 -U} 

Run this code to find the username.

So the user k is Kay and j is Jan.

Answer: jan


#### What is the password?
If you are not able to locate the rockyou.txt file, then browse it for your laptop and you will find it in the internet.

Hydra is the powerful tool to brute force. Using hydra I got the userâ€™s password.

Answer: armando

#### What service do you use to access the server(answer in abbreviation in all caps)?
Now I have the username and password, so it is easy to login to ssh. Therefore I will use the ssh service to access the server. 

Answer: SSH

#### What is the name of the other user you found(all lower case)?
Earlier we found two usernames Jan and kay.

Answer: kay

#### What is the final password you obtain?
Once we login to kay, i will get the passphrase. Next use john the ripper to brute force the passphrase then we will get the final password.

Answer: heresareallystrongpasswordthatfollowsthepasswordpolicy$$

### Conclusion
This room gives an opportunity to learn the real scenario of pentesting. From this room, I learned brute forcing, hash cracking and service enumeration.
