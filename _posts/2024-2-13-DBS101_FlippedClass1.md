### Topic : Database Users and Database Administrators
----

In our flipped class session, I learned about Different Types of Database Users and, what are the Roles and Responsibilities of Database Administrator. 
Firstly, there are 7 different types of database users that are categorized based up on their interaction with database:
1)Database Administrator(controls the 3 levels of database[Physical level, Logical level, View level])
2)Naive/Parametric End Users( individuals lacking DBMS knowledge who frequently utilize database applications for specific tasks)
3)System Analyst
4)Sophisticated users(who have DBMS knowledge)
5)Database Designers
6)Application Programmers
7)Casual Users/Temporary Users
8)Specialized users

Secondly, the roles and responsibilities of a Database Administrators are to manage relationships with vendors, conduct audits, offer technical support, implement polocies, develop solutions, troubleshoot issues, maintain documentation, and optimize databases for efficient usage.

A brief information about the things we did in our flipped class session. We were asked to be sitted in our Experts Group(a group in which each students learn and become master). After 20 minutes we were again asked to go to our respected Home Group(a group in which each memeber share the knowledge they acquired from their Experts Group).

During the flipped class session, I have encountered and learned the lack of time for discussion among experts group. As students studied individually and didn't get time to discuss before going to their home group. I suggest some more time in experts group discussion.
