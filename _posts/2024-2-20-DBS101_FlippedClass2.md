### Topic : Entity Relastionship Diagram

In our second flipped class, we were divided in groups of 4 students to work on Entity Relationship Diagram. Each group was assigned with one topic to create a Entity Relationship Diagram and we were given 50 minutes for discussion and to prepare the diagram. After the discussion each group was given 10 minutes for class presentation.

From this flipped class, it was expected for us to understand Entity Relationship Modeling and learn to draw Entity Relationship Diagram for a real world system.
For our flipped class, our tutor provided us resources for us to get more information.

The topic that my group got was to create ERD for an "Online health book(E-health) system" which focuses on health records.
From flipped class I have summed up and drew a ERD diagram which represents "E-health".
