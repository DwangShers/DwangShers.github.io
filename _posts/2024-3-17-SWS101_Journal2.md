## Topic : HackTheBox Tier 0 and Tier 1
----
HACK THE BOX is a platform to improve cybersecurity skills to the next level through the most captivating, gamified, hands-on training experience.

For this journal2, we were supposed to complete TIER 0 and TIER 1.

---
### Learning Outcome:

From the tier, you will gain essential skills in the world of cybersecurity pen-testing. You’ll start by learning how to connect to various services, such as FTP, SMB, Telnet, Rsync, and RDP
Anonymously. Next, you’ll discover the power of Nmap, a valuable tool for identifying open ports on target systems, allowing you to assess their vulnerabilities. Lastly, you’ll explore connecting to a MongoDB server, adding a valuable layer to your penetration testing knowledge. This tier will lay a strong foundation for your journey into the realm of cybersecurity.

### Tier 0

In this tier we will cover the absolute fundamentals of attacking a Machine. We will learn how to connect to the VPN, perform basic enumeration of ports and services, and interact with the services.

First login to Hack the Box, then go to the Starting point where you can find basics learning for penetration testing. There are three tiers [tier 0, tier1, tier 2].
For this journal, like I mentioned, I will be covering only tier 0 and tier 1.

In tier 0 there are 8 sections with tasks in it. That are as following;

### Meow

To attack the target machine, we must be on the same network. So, connect to the Starting Point VPN using one of the following options.

I prefer using OpVPN. Connect to it by following the instructions.

![alt text](<../image/Screenshot from 2024-03-31 13-32-03.png>)

After downloading the VPN, open the terminal and connect to the VPN.

If you are connected, you will see this on the right corner in HTB.

![alt text](<../image/Screenshot from 2024-03-31 13-42-41.png>)

Then Spawn Machine and get the TARGET MACHINE IP ADDRESS. This is mine.

![alt text](<../image/Screenshot from 2024-03-31 13-43-51.png>)

Then complete the Tasks:

#### Task 1

![alt text](<../image/Screenshot from 2024-03-31 13-45-12.png>)

#### Task 2

![alt text](<../image/Screenshot from 2024-03-31 13-45-53.png>)

#### Task 3

![alt text](<../image/Screenshot from 2024-03-31 13-47-14.png>)

#### Task 4

![alt text](<../image/Screenshot from 2024-03-31 13-48-27.png>)

#### Task 5

![alt text](<../image/Screenshot from 2024-03-31 13-49-01.png>)

#### Task 6

![alt text](<../image/Screenshot from 2024-03-31 13-49-25.png>)

#### Task 7

![alt text](<../image/Screenshot from 2024-03-31 13-49-49.png>)

#### Summit Flag

To solve this task, we need to root flag and perform a scan on the target IP using nmap.

![alt text](<../image/Screenshot from 2024-03-31 13-51-44.png>)

![alt text](<../image/Screenshot from 2024-03-31 13-52-22.png>)

The port 23/tcp is open.

Now, type the command telnet with Target_IP in terminal to connect to the server

![alt text](<../image/Screenshot from 2024-03-31 13-53-20.png>)

Now use ls command to get all the folders/files available in that server.
We can see the flag.txt file and use cat command to view the content.

### Fawn

Now to go on with FAWN, you must stop the machine of MEOW.

Then spawn machine of FAWN to get the IP of the target machine.

This is my target machine.

#### Task 1

![alt text](<../image/Screenshot from 2024-03-31 13-56-45.png>)

#### Task 2

![alt text](<../image/Screenshot from 2024-03-31 13-57-28.png>)

#### Task 4

![alt text](<../image/Screenshot from 2024-03-31 13-58-48.png>)

#### Task 5

We must use this command to solve task 5 and task 6.

![alt text](<../image/Screenshot from 2024-03-31 13-59-32.png>)

![alt text](<../image/Screenshot from 2024-03-31 14-00-13.png>)

### Redeemer

To solve the tasks run nmap scan on the Target_IP as shown below, 

nmap -p- --min-rate 5000 -sV [target_ip]

I am using -Pn because the host seemed down.
